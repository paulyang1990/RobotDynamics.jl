Quadvine
- separate torque controls for each vine link

Quadvine2
- same torque control for each vine link

Quadvine3
- add stiffness and damping as f(current state, u)
- simulate pouch motors as B*u
- make vine control derviative of torque (for bandwidth limits)

Quadvine4
- add stiffness and damping as f(next state, u)
